# Cyber-Threat-Identification

Cyber threats pose a significant risk to online services in today's interconnected world. Unauthorized access attempts and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks can disrupt critical internet-based operations, leading to financial losses and compromised user trust. This project focuses on developing a sophisticated Cyber Threat Detection System to protect online services from malicious network activities.

The system utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze network traffic patterns and identify potential threats. By leveraging datasets such as UNSW-NB15 and UNRIDD, the project aims to create a robust defense mechanism capable of recognizing and mitigating evolving cyber attack strategies. The research compares the performance of various machine learning classifiers, including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting, to determine the most effective approach for threat detection.

Through correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction, the project seeks to optimize the detection process by reducing data redundancy. The ultimate goal is to develop a dynamic defense strategy that can adapt to new and emerging threat patterns, thereby enhancing the security posture of online services and safeguarding them from potential disruptions.
